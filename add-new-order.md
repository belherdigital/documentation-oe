Any new purchase that happens on your website is registered as a new order at your admin panel, which is useful to access information about new sales.

But sometimes you might get a payment through a different method than the payment gateways within Open eShop, or you might want to register a cash payment and add it to your sales statistics. here are the steps to do so:

- Log in to your admin panel
- go to **eShop** tab -> **Orders** and press on **New**

Here you need to fill in the following fields:

**Name:** the preferred name of the order or client.<br>
**Email:** The e-mail the product will be sent to and registered with, this field is very important.<br>
**Paymethod:** How you would like to register the payment method for your order.<br>
**Product:** Will be selected from a drop-down menu containing all of your products<br>
**Currency:** Self explanatory. ex USD.<br>
**Amount:** The payment you want to register<br>
**Pay Date:** Pick the day you want to register the sale at.<br>
**Notes:** You have 245 characters to put whatever text you wish to add for future references.
