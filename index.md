Open eShop is an eCommerce software that helps you run a fully functional digital goods store with little to no knowledge in web-design or web-development. It is a free open source software, so it’s ready for any modification from developers or advanced users.

The purpose of the software is to give an easy tool for the everyday internet user to sell their designs, music, ebooks, software packages or any digital good they can think of action without the hindrances of lack of technology knowledge, funds or human resources.

The software can be used for a variety of purposes, with lots of customization possibilities. While currently it’s only applicable for digital goods (due to lack of logistics support, shipping ..etc) but if you can find a solution for that then you can also use it for other kinds of goods, we saw some of our users selling shirts!

The team behind OE is consistently improving the software, working on new releases, adding new features and trying to find good deals for future and existing clients.

As part of the team’s efforts to provide a full solution we have arranged an agreement with our hosting affiliates, through this agreement you could purchase a hosting from them and with that you will have a fully functional premium theme from Open eShop with three months of support after the purchase.
