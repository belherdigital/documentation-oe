There are many hosting providers that are compatible with Open eShop, but what differs compatible hosting providers from the others? Well, it's about our software requirements, which are pretty much standard for an eCommerce solution but there could be some hosting companies that don't use the latest technologies.

## Software requirements to install Open eShop

+ A computer with the Internet connection
+ An internet browser
+ A web hosting provider

**More technical ones:**

+ MySQL 5+
+ Apache 2+
+ PHP 5.5+ or higher
+ Short Tags
+ mod_rewrite
+ GD support
+ mcrypt
+ Gettext
+ Curl

## Where can I Host My Online Store?

It happens sometimes that a user purchases a hosting plan at some company, then downloads Open eShop and tries to run it on his website. Following those steps the user can get surprised with unexpected errors. Most of the times that is due to an incompatible hosting with Open eShop. To prevent that from happening and with Chema's help we prepared a list of **16 hosting providers** that we tested and they're working with Open eShop. We also included a list of tested hosting providers that are not working with our software.

My personal recommendation would be [Inmotion Hosting](https://secure1.inmotionhosting.com/cgi-bin/gby/clickthru.cgi?id=chema&page=7&campaign=blog_post) if you're in the US and [A2 hosting](https://partners.a2hosting.com/solutions.php?id=4636) if you're in Europe, Middle-east and North Africa. They're both good with 24/7 technical support. All companies have pros and cons but for me I feel comfortable when dealing with those two companies.
