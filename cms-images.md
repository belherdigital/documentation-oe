Managing images that uploaded from editor it's easier since our 2.2.0 version. If you upload an image when you create a page or edit an email template or publish a blog post or create a FAQ, the uploaded image will be saved in /images/cms/ folder.

To manage those images go to your **Panel**, **Content -> CMS Images**.
