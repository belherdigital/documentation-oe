At some stage after the development of your eShop, you will need to delegate other people to do some work for you, like translation.

For that, you can create a new user role or change the role of a user to translator.

To create a new role:

1. Go to your **Panel**, **Users** -> **Roles**. 
2. Create a **new role** and press **Submit**.
3. **Edit** the newly created role.
4. You will find a long list of **privileges**, pick the ones you need to give access to and press **Update**.
5. Go to **Users** > **Users** in your Admin Panel.
6. Choose the user you want to edit his role.
7. Change his role to the new one you created 
8. Done!

Normal **user** has access to:

+ profile.*
+ support.* 

<br>
**Translator** can access:

+ content.* 
+ profile.* 
+ translations.* 

<br>
**Admin** can access all the areas.
