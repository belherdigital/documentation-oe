Adding a logo to your online store is a simple process that normally takes less than 5 minutes when you have a [premium Open eShop theme](https://open-eshop.com/market/). And it wouldn't matter if you're selling ebooks, selling music or any other digital good, your online store needs a logo!

**You just need to follow those steps:**

1. Log into your FTP, or open your file manager from hosting Cpanel

2. Get your logo file ready in your preferred format with the recommended dimensions of **250px by 40 px**

3. Upload your logo design wherever you prefer, for example let's say you upload it in the images folder so the URL would be http://YOURDOMAIN.com/images/logo.png

4. Now log in to your **Open eShop admin panel**

5. Go to **Appearance > Theme options**

6. Paste the URL into the **URL to your logo** field ([Premium themes only](https://open-eshop.com/market/#.VBqR3fl_u30))

7. Click **Update** and your logo should show up.

If your logo doesn't show up right away try **deleting cache** and **browsing in private/incognito mode** because your website might be cached on your browser.
