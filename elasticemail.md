Sending messages to a large number of users can become easier and more secure with [ElasticEmail](https://elasticemail.com/account#/open-classifieds) integrated into your e-mailing function in Open eShop. You would do that for multiple reasons. Some of them could be: your server can’t send e-mails, e-mails are not reaching users’ inbox or you want to trace the e-mails you’re sending.

**How it works:**

Here are the simple steps you need to do to have it integrated into your website:

1. Set up an [ElasticEmail](https://elasticemail.com/account#/open-classifieds) account.

2. Go to  your **account info** (as shown in the picture):

3\. Scroll down to **SMTP/API Configuration**.

4\. Copy the information from there (you will need the **username**, **password**)

5\. Go to your **panel**, **Settings -> Email**, switch **ElasticEmail active ON**, enter your **account email address** in API Username field and your **account password** in API Password field.

6\. Press **Save**.

Now every e-mail you send using Open eShop admin panel will be sent through your ElasticEmail account.
