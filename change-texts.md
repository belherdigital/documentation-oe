Changing texts can come very handy if you want to customize Open eShop to suit your online shop needs. And doing that is very simple, **here are the steps that you need to follow:**

+ Log into your Admin Panel
+ Go to Content > Translations
+ Click on the Edit button for the currently active language

![change texts]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/change-texts.png)

+ Search for the text that you need to change by pressing (CTRL + F) and typing the text in
+ Edit the box with text on the right side
+ Press the button next to it
