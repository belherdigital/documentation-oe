**Coupons** are a great tool for giving **special discounts to individual customers**, or when you have a deal that comes rarely you could also create a coupon manually each time.

To create a coupon Log in to your Admin Panel, go to **eShop tab > Coupons**, press **New** and fill in the following fields:

![coupon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/coupon.png)

+ **ID product:** Which product you wish to apply the coupon on. If none selected would apply to all the products.
+ **Name:** This is the name of the coupon, and this determines the link given to the beneficiary.
+ **Notes:** Free text field, useful for future references.
+ **Discount Amount:** In case you want to cut from product price, input here how much you want to cut.
+ **Discount Percentage:** Similar to the amount field, but here you could put a percentage of how much you want to cut from the price, and you don’t have to put %.
+ **Number Coupons:** How many coupons you want to create with the same settings above.
+ **Valid Date:** After this date the coupon will no longer be valid.
+ **Status:** you have to check this box if you want the coupon to become active.

Press Submit and your coupon is ready to use.

Now you have **two different ways to offer the coupon**:

+ give the coupon name to the beneficiary, and then it’s up to theme to input the coupon name at the box when browsing the product.
+ Or you could do the following:
  - Go to the product you selected above, then write at the end of its link something like this:
  - **Whateveryouhavebefore/product.html?coupon=** and here you need to insert the **coupon name**.

After you’ve done that test your link and make sure that it’s working, then send it to the beneficiary.
