Widgets are very useful elements of your digital goods store interface they provide an easy way to navigate and access different parts of your website, giving a better experience for your online buyers. You can select which one you want to activate and embed it on your website. And with our script for selling digital goods there is no limit for adding the widgets per page.

To see the list of widgets go to **Panel**, select **Appearance** and choose **Widgets** from the left sidebar or simply select this option from the bookmark in the headline.

Select a widget and press **Create**. Choose the place where you want a widget displayed (sidebar, footer or header). In the same way you can render widgets inoperative by selecting an option **Inactive**. Finish up with the rest of the settings and hit **Save Changes**.

On the right side of the screen you can see all created widgets. You can always edit them. Change the place and order of **displaying the widget** simply by dragging and dropping.

After creating or editing the widgets changes might not be visible on the site unless you **delete cache** (Tools > Cache on the left sidebar and press Delete all).
