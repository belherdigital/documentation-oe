It's important to have your Time Zone correctly set up. For example, ads, orders, reviews, topics and replies on forum, blog posts etc, will not display the date or time you expect if you don't have the correct timezone set in Open-Classifieds.

**To change the Time Zone, follow these steps:**

1. Go to **Panel**, **Settings -> General**
2. Under the **Regional Settings** section, **Time Zone** field, select your city or the city with the same timezone as yours.
3. Press **Save**
