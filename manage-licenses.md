If your product requires a license, then the software automatically generates a license and send it to users when they purchase the product. 

It's possible to manage those licenses by loggin in to your admin panel and go to **eShop** -> **Licenses**. You can **Edit** or **Delete** the licenses using the buttons under Actions column:

![licenses]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/licenses.png)

### Edit License

Some times you may need to edit the details of a license, like the Domain or the Ip Address that is activated on or to activate or deactivate the license. Below you can see which other details of the license you can update:

+ **Id Product:** Choose the product that is using this license.
+ **Id User:** Which user owns this license.
+ **Id Order:** The id of the order that this license has been purchased.
+ **License:** The license number.
+ **Domain:** The domain name that the license is activated on.
+ **Device Id:** The id of the device the license is activated on.
+ **Ip Address:** The Ip Address the license is activated on.
+ **Created:** The date and time this license has been created.
+ **Valid Date:** Until when the license is valid.
+ **License Check Date:**
+ **Status:** Checked if the license is still valid.


### Delete Licenses

If a license has expired or it's not in use anymore, you can go to **eShop -> Licenses** and delete it. By deleting the unused licenses you can have only the active licenses listed and make it easier to manage them.


### Export Licenses

Instead of having all the licenses in your panel, you can export them to a csv file by clicking Export All at the bottom of the page.
