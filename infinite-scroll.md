When you are selling many digital goods in your online store and when you donâ€™t want to show them in multiple pages you can make your products show in one page and appear as your users scroll down the product listing page by activating **infinite scroll**.

This feature is available only for the [Premium Themes](https://open-eshop.com/market/). To activate infinite Scroll follow the next steps:

1. Go to **Appearance > Theme options**
2. Change **Infinite scroll** to **YES**
3. Press **Update**

And it will be working perfectly!
