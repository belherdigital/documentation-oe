You already installed Open eShop and your website is up and running, but now you come to the step where you need to add your digital goods to your market.

## How to add a new product

Here are the **steps to add a product**:

+ Log in to your **Admin Panel**
+ Go to **Products** and press a blue button: **New**

Once you do that you will get to a form that needs to be filled with the product information (not all fields are mandatory). I will explain each point in that form and what it does exactly (there are some very useful boxes here).

**General information**

**Category:** You pick the relevant category from the options that you already created in the categories section.<br>
**Price:** The proposed price for a product.<br>
**Currency:** The currency for your product.<br>
**Title:** Product name.<br>
**Description:** Input here the text you want to show when users are viewing the product.

**Details**

**Price:** Self explanatory.<br>
**Price offer:** Use this box when you want to make an offer on that product (it would override the original price for a specific period of time).<br>
**Offer valid:** The end date of the price offer (after that date the original price will be active).

**Support Details**

**Licenses:** Indicate how many licenses you want to include with your product.<br>
**License Days:** Indicate how long the licenses will be valid for.<br>
**Support Days:** Indicate for how long you want the buyer to have access to support system.<br>

**Additional information**

**Url demo:** If you have a demo for your product paste the URL here.<br>
**Version:** Indicate the version number for the product (if applies).<br>
**Skins:** If you have different skins for a product you could add them here by typing the name of the skin and hitting Enter on keyboard.<br>
**Purchase notes, sent via email:** Type whatever you prefer to send to any user that purchases this product.

At the bottom section you could upload screenshots or product images and upload your product file.

When everything is ready press **Save**.

You could easily **show and hide a product** by checking and un-checking the **Active** check-box at the bottom.

## How do I notify clients of new product release?

When you are updating your product (OE Panel > eShop > Products) at the end of a page there is a checkbox that once selected will send an email to all the buyers of that product notifying them of the new update. See the screenshot below.
